45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	When these edges overlap in a light spectrum , green results ; when they overlap in a dark spectrum , magenta results .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	Based on his experiments with turbid media , Goethe characterized color as arising from the dynamic interplay of darkness and light .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	He saw only reddish-yellow edges and blue-cyan edges with white between them , and the spectrum arose only where these edges came close enough to overlap .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	With a light spectrum , coming out of the prism , one sees a shaft of light surrounded by dark .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	Goethe sought to show that , as a turbid medium , the prism was an integral factor in the arising of color .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	Goethe 's concern was not so much with the analytic measurement of color phenomenon , as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	Whereas Newton narrowed the beam of light in order to isolate the phenomenon , Goethe observed that with a wider aperture , there was no spectrum .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	Starting from these observations , he began numerous experiments , observing the effects of darkening and lightening on the perception of color in many different circumstances .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	For him , the spectrum could be explained by the simpler phenomena of color arising from the interaction of light and dark edges .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	Goethe 's studies of color began with subjective experiments which examined the effects of turbid media on the perception of light and dark .

45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	Some kinds of vandalism go unnoticed for months , sometimes over 6 months , so there is no hurry to revert all hackings made in low-traffic articles .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	However , long term , it might be more efficient if the hacking + erase really disappeared from the article storage at some point .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	Also , an erase could complicate the wikiserver databases , unless an erase was treated as a `` delete '' transaction in the storage .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	Of course , thousands of revisions could be generated by renaming `` metre '' to `` meter '' or some similar minor changes .

45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	However , actually erasing specific revisions from an article might require changing , or reconfiguring , the software behind Wikipedia , the MediaWiki system .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	Those combined `` Try + Erase '' transactions could be removed from the system after some period of time .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	Many revisions of Wikipedia articles are very minor and could be `` pruned '' from the overall History of article revisions , to leave only the more major revisions .
45	Russian	Postgraduate	C2	The process of erasing a revision should require some special authority to avoid edit-wars that would use erase to negate other contributions .

25	Polish	Undergraduate	C1	Likewise , it can never have zero energy , meaning that the particle can never `` sit still '' .
25	Polish	Undergraduate	C1	This can be explained in terms of the uncertainty principle , which states that the product of the uncertainties in the position and momentum of a particle is limited by .

52	German	Postgraduate	C1	After its release , Manson revealed that the over-arching story within the trilogy is divulged in reverse chronological order .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	The first was a `` graphic and phantasmagoric '' novelized adaptation of the script intended to be released shortly after the record .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	Consequently , after canceling the remaining dates of their Rock Is Dead Tour , the band retreated from public view .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	Manson 's also remembered to write some great pop-goth tunes this time out , nowhere more so than with first single ` Disposable Teens ' .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	It took the album three years to attain a gold certification from the RIAA in March 2003 for shipments of over 500,000 units .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	In the US , the album debuted and peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of 117,000 , initially making it a commercial disappointment .

52	German	Postgraduate	C1	Holy Wood , therefore , begins the story , followed by Mechanical Animals , and concluding with Antichrist Superstar .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	Bon Harris , of seminal EBM group , Nitzer Ebb was also brought in to supply programming and pre-production editing .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	Manson had begun writing material for the record as early as 1995 , prior to the release of Antichrist Superstar in 1996 .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	He cites , as examples , icons of American assassination such as John Lennon , John F. Kennedy and Jesus Christ who have attained cult-of-personality celebrity-worship as a result .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	It is a rock opera concept album and the third and final installment in a trilogy that includes Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	Since stating that it `` will be my only contact with humanity '' , Marilyn Manson employed regular updates to generate interest among fans .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	As early as April 30 , 2001 , there were already speculation that the `` The Nobodies '' would be chosen as the album 's third single .
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	It is subsequently deplored with a quip often attributed to Joseph Stalin , `` One death is a tragedy . 	6:quip	3:deplored
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	More important , there are a bunch of plain brilliant tracks where Manson anoints bits of rock history into his own church . 	13:anoints
52	German	Postgraduate	C1	Manson 's ambitions for the project initially included an accompanying original screenplay of the same name which would further explore the album 's backstory .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	When a new computer is purchased in some places , laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Some say that it was the holy grail that was carried out of the fortress , others say it was documents showing that the the Cathars were right and that the Church was wrong in some way .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	The people of the town who were mostly Catholic , said that rather than turn over their friends and kin , `` we would rather be flayed alive . 	26:flayed
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	However , a human must observe the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight , so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	A dictionary has been designed to have one or more functions that can help the user in a particular situation .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Knowledge-oriented functions give help when the user wants to acquire specific knowledge about a particular matter or just acquire general knowledge ( knowledge building ) .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	The surface of the Earth is mostly covered by salty water in its ocean s. It has six continent s which rise above the oceans to form land .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	The Earth 's atmosphere is made of roughly 78 % nitrogen , 21 % oxygen and small amounts of other gases .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	The island of Ireland is currently divided into : the Republic of Ireland , also known as ` the Republic ' ; Northern Ireland , also known as the ` six counties ' or ` Ulster ' .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	The four largest islands are Honshu , Hokkaido , Shikoku , and Kyushu , and there are approximately 3,000 smaller islands in the chain .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract ; that which derives from , but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	For example , it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like God , the number three , and goodness are real , abstract , or both .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Although the concepts `` cat '' and `` telephone '' are abstractions , they are not abstract in the sense of the objects in graph 1 above .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Questions about the properties of things are then propositions about predicates , which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	In music , the term abstraction can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation , and may sometimes indicate abandonment of tonality .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	During the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan , he led the Czech national ice hockey team to its first and only Olympic gold medal .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	From 1993 to 2001 , he won six Vezina Trophies , and in 1998 he became the first goaltender to win consecutive Hart Trophies .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	He is best known for his concentration , foot speed , flexibility , and unconventional saves , such as covering the puck with his blocker rather than his trapper .

23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	He has appeared as a panelist on Yugoslav press on ABC 's `` Press International '' in Chicago and PBS 's `` International Dateline '' in New Orleans . 	5:panelist
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Waltzing Matilda , Waltzing Matilda `` You 'll come a-Waltzing Matilda , with me '' `` Where 's that jolly jumbuck you 've got in your tucker bag ? 	20:jumbuck	26:tucker
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Sometimes these properties are also used for defining the dot product , especially in 2 and 3 dimensions ; this definition is equivalent to the above one .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	The geometric properties rely on the basis being orthonormal , i.e. composed of pairwise perpendicular vectors with unit length .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	This definition naturally reduces to the standard vector dot product when applied to vectors , and matrix multiplication when applied to matrices .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	so we conclude that taking the dot product of a vector v with itself yields the squared length of the vector .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	In other words , for an orthonormal space with any number of dimensions , the dot product is invariant under a coordinate transformation based on an orthogonal matrix .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Many geometric properties can be salvaged , at the cost of giving up the symmetric and bilinear properties of the scalar product , by alternatively defining .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	which is easier to remember as `` BAC minus CAB '' , keeping in mind which vectors are dotted together .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Then the scalar product of any vector with itself is a non-negative real number , and it is nonzero except for the zero vector .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	It is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding components of two matrices having the same size .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	This type of scalar product is nevertheless quite useful , and leads to the notions of Hermitian form and of general inner product spaces .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	For vectors with complex entries , using the given definition of the dot product would lead to quite different geometric properties .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Due to the geometric interpretation of the dot product the norm a of a vector a in such an inner product space is defined as .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	creating a triangle with sides a , b , and c. According to the law of cosines , we have .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	The dot product between a tensor of order n and a tensor of order m is a tensor of order n + m-2 .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	The dot product is also a scalar in this sense , given by the formula , independent of the coordinate system .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	The following properties hold if a , b , and c are real vectors and r is a scalar .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Sion is the third largest wine making region in Switzerland , however , the valuable agricultural land and vineyards are undergoing constant regression due to the process of urbanisation .
23	Russian	Postgraduate	C1	Participated Aerobatic teams have been for example the Frecce Tricolori from Italy was well as the Patrouille de France .
